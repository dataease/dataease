        <h2>Create Viewshed</h2><p/>
        <h2><img src="./images/GUID-491E9A75-30CC-4526-9F71-E47FD25536DE-web.png" alt="Create Viewshed"></h2>
        <hr/>
    <p>The Create Viewshed tool creates areas where
an observer can see objects on the ground. The input observer
points can represent either observers (such as people on the ground
or lookouts in a fire tower) or observed objects (such as wind
turbines, water towers, vehicles, or other people). The result areas are those areas where the observers
can see the observed objects and vice versa: the observed objects
can see the observers.
    </p>
    <p>Both the
observers and the observed objects  can have a height above ground, and these heights are used in determining visibility.
For example, a viewshed computed for 400-foot wind turbines and six-foot people standing on the ground will typically be larger  than a viewshed computed for 200-foot turbines and six-foot people.
    </p>
    <p>Note that the computation of the viewshed does
not account for obstructions such as trees or buildings. You can
think of the computation as occurring on bare ground devoid of
anything but the observer and observed objects.
    </p>
    <p>The  result layer contains   area features representing visible areas. The  <i>Frequency</i> field  records the number of observer points that can see each area. For example, if you have five input points, each  representing a fire lookout tower, the <i>Frequency</i> field will have values between one and five; areas with a value of one can only be seen by one tower, and areas with a value of five can be seen by all towers. The result layer also contains the <i>DEMResolution</i> field, which records the resolution  of the digital elevation model (DEM) used to create the viewsheds.
    </p>
    <p>If  <b>Use current map extent</b> is checked, only the observer points that are visible within the current map extent will be analyzed.  If unchecked, all observer points in the input  layer will be analyzed, even if they are outside the current map extent.

            <p>In addition to choosing a layer from your map, you can select  <b>Choose Analysis Layer</b> found at the bottom of the drop-down list. This option opens a gallery where you can browse to and select datasets from various sources to use in your analysis.

            <p>This is the height of  structures or people on the ground used to establish visibility. The result viewshed are those areas where an observer point can see these other objects.  The converse is also true; the other objects can see an observer point.

                <ul>
                    <li>If your observer points represent wind turbines and you want to determine where people standing on the ground can see the turbines, enter the average height of a person (approximately 6 feet).  The result is those areas where a person standing on the ground can see the wind turbines.
                    </li>
                    <li>If your observer points represent fire lookout towers and you want to determine which lookout towers can see a smoke plume 20 feet high or higher, enter 20 feet for the height.  The result is those areas where a fire lookout tower can see a smoke plume at least 20 feet high.
                    </li>
                    <li>If your observer points represent scenic overlooks along roads and trails and you want to determine where wind turbines 400 feet high or higher can be seen, enter 400 feet for the height.  The result is those areas where a person standing at a scenic overlook can see a wind turbine at least 400 feet high.
                    </li>
                    <li>If your observer points represent scenic overlooks and you want to determine how much area on the ground people standing at the overlook can see, enter zero.  The result is those areas that can be seen from the scenic overlook.
