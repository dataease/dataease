        <hr/>
    <p>A buffer is an area that covers a given distance from a point, line, or area feature.

    </p>
    <p>Buffers are typically used to create areas that can be further analyzed using other tools. For example, if the question is What buildings are within 1 mile of the school?, the answer can be found by creating a 1-mile buffer around the school and overlaying the buffer with the layer containing building footprints. The end result is a layer of those buildings within 1 mile of the school.
    </p>
    </div>
    <!--Parameter divs for each param-->

        <div><h2>Choose layer to apply buffer to</h2></div>
        <hr/>
        <div>
            <p>The  point, line, or area features
to be buffered. The input  layers must be in a projected coordinate system or the processing spatial reference must be set to a projected coordinate system using the  <b>Analysis Environments</b>.
            </p>
            <p>In addition to choosing a layer from your map, you can choose  <b>Choose Analysis Layer</b> at the bottom of the drop-down list to browse to your contents for a big data file share dataset or feature layer. You may optionally apply a filter on your input layer or apply a selection on hosted layers added to your map. Filters and selections are only applied for analysis.

        <hr/>
        <div>
            <p>There are three ways you can specify the size of the buffer for your input features: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Specify a distance that is applied to all features.
                    </li>
                    <li>Specify a field on the input layer that contains the distance value. You can use a string field or a numeric field. If a linear unit is not defined, the units of the spatial reference will be used. If you are using a geographic coordinate system, the unitless field will be assumed to be meters. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Build an expression with multiple fields and mathematical operators. For example, to buffer by 10 times the value of a field named  <i>wind_speed</i> add the expression <i>$feature[&quot;wind_speed&quot;] x 10</i>.
                    </li>

large areas and any geographic coordinate system.

        <hr/>
        <div>
            <p>You can calculate statistics on features that are summarized. You can calculate the following on numeric fields: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Count&mdash;Calculates the number of nonnull values. It can be used on numeric fields or strings. The count of [null, 0, 2] is 2.
                    </li>
                    <li>Sum&mdash;The sum of numeric values in a field. The sum of [null, null, 3] is 3.
                    </li>
                    <li>Mean&mdash;The mean of numeric values. The mean of [0, 2, null] is 1.
                    </li>
                    <li>Min&mdash;The minimum value of a numeric field. The minimum of [0, 2, null] is 0. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Max&mdash;The maximum value of a numeric field. The maximum value of [0, 2, null] is 2.
                    </li>
                    <li>Range&mdash;The range of a numeric field. This is calculated as the minimum values subtracted from the maximum value. The range of [0, null, 1] is 1. The range of [null, 4] is 0.
                    </li>
                    <li>Variance&mdash;The variance of a numeric field in a track. The  variance of [1] is null. The variance of [null, 1,0,1,1] is 0.25.
                    </li>
                    <li>Standard deviation&mdash;The standard deviation of a numeric field. The standard deviation of [1] is null. The standard deviation of [null, 1,0,1,1] is 0.5. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>
            <p>You can calculate the following on string fields:
                <ul>
                    <li>Count&mdash;The number of nonnull strings.
                    </li>
                    <li>Any&mdash;This statistic is a random sample of a string value in the specified field.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                All statistics are calculated on nonnull values. The resulting layer will contain a new field for each statistic calculated. Any number of statistics can be added by choosing an attribute and statistic.

    <div id="dataStore">
        <div><h2>Choose an ArcGIS Data Store to save results to</h2></div>
        <hr/>
        <div>
            <p>GeoAnalytics results are stored to an data store and exposed as a feature layer in   Portal for ArcGIS. In most cases, results should be stored to the spatiotemporal data store and this is the default. In some cases, saving results to the  relational data store is a good option. The following are reasons why you may want to store results to the relational data store: 
                <ul>
                    <li>You can use results in portal-to-portal collaboration.
                    </li>
                    <li>You can enable sync capabilities with your results.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>
            <p>You should not use the relational data store if you expect your GeoAnalytics results to increase and need to take advantage of the spatiotemporal big data store's capabilities to handle large amounts of data.

            <p> The name of the layer that will be created.  If you are writing to an ArcGIS Data Store, your results will be saved in  <b>My

tool name and the input layer name. If the layer already exists, the tool will fail.
            </p>
            <p>When writing to   ArcGIS Data Store  (relational or spatiotemporal big data store) using the  <b>Save result in</b> drop-down box, you can specify
