    <p>The Build Multi-Variable Grid tool works with one or more layers of point, line, or polygon features. The tool generates a grid of square or hexagonal bins and calculates values for each bin based on the proximity of each input layer. These values can include the following variables: 

    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li> <b>Distance to Nearest</b>&mdash;The distance from each bin to the nearest feature
            </li>
            <li> <b>Attribute of Nearest</b>&mdash;A field value of the feature nearest to each bin
            </li>
            <li> <b>Summary of Nearby</b>&mdash;A specified statistic of all features within a distance of each bin
            </li>
            <li> <b>Summary of Intersecting</b>&mdash;A specified statistic of all features that intersect each bin
            </li>
        </ul>
        
    </p>
    <p>Only variables you specify will be included in the result layer. These variables can help you understand the proximity and distribution of your data. The results can help you begin to answer questions such as the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Given multiple layers of public transportation infrastructure, what part of the city is least accessible by public transportation?
            </li>
            <li>Given layers of waterways, such as lakes and rivers, what is the name of the water body closest to each  location in the U.S.?
            </li>
            <li>Given a layer of household income, where in the U.S. is the variation of income in the surrounding 50 miles the greatest?
            </li>
        </ul>

            <p>This analysis uses bins and requires a projected coordinate system. You can set the processing coordinate system in Analysis Environments. If your processing coordinate system is not set to a projected coordinate system, you will be prompted to set it when you run analysis .

            <p>In addition to choosing a layer from your map, you can choose  <b>Choose Analysis Layer</b> at the bottom of the drop-down list to browse to your contents for a big data file share dataset or feature layer. You may optionally apply a filter on your input layer or apply a selection on hosted layers added to your map. Filters and selections are only applied for analysis. 
            </p>
            <p>Once you have chosen an input layer, click the  <b>Add a variable</b> button to open a new variable for editing. You must provide a unique name for each variable. This will be the name of the field that is created in the attribute table of the result layer.
            </p>
            <p>Use the drop-down menu to select the type of variable to add. Each variable type must be configured with a unique set of parameters, and all parameters are required.

            <p>Once you have added all desired variables for the chosen layer, click the  <b>Add</b> button to save the variables.
