    <p>This tool finds features (and portions of features) that are within the boundaries of areas in the first input layer.  For example:
        <ul>
            <li>Given a layer of watershed boundaries and a layer of land-use boundaries by land-use type, calculate total acreage of land-use type for each watershed. 
            </li>
            <li>Given a layer of parcels in a county and a layer of city boundaries, summarize the average value of vacant parcels within each city boundary.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <p>If  <b>Use current map extent</b> is checked, only those features in the input layer and the layer to be summarized that are visible within the current map extent will be analyzed.  If unchecked, all features in both the input layer and the  layer to be summarized will be analyzed, even if they are outside the current map extent.
