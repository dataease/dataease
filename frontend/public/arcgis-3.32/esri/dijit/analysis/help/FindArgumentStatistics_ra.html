    <p>Extracts the dimension value  or band index at which a given statistic is attained for each pixel in a multidimensional or multiband raster.
    </p>
    <p>Use this tool to extract the dimension value (for example the date, height, or depth) at which a specific statistic is reached in the stack of rasters in a multidimensional raster dataset. Alternatively find the band number at which the statistic is reached in a multiband raster.
    </p>
    <p>For example, you may want to know  the month in which each pixel reached the highest sea surface temperature over 30 years of data collection. Another example is you have an eight-band remote sensing image and you want to know the band in which the minimum reflectance value was reached for each pixel.
    </p>
    <p>If  <b>Use current map extent</b> is checked, variables or bands of the layer that are  visible within the current map extent will be analyzed. If unchecked, variables or bands of the full layer will be analyzed, even if they are outside the current map extent.
