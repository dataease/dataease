    <p>Overlay Layers combines two or more layers into one layer.  You can think of overlay as peering through a stack of maps and creating a single map containing all the information found in the stack.   
 Overlay is more than a merging of line
work; all the attributes of the features in the overlay
are included in the final product. Overlay is used to answer one of the most basic questions of geography: What is on top of what? 
    </p>
    <p>The following are examples:
        <ul>
            <li>What parcels are within the 100-year floodplain? (Within is another way of saying on top of.)
                  
            </li>
            <li>What land use is on top of what soil type?
                 
            </li>
            <li>What wells are within abandoned military bases?
            </li>
        </ul>
        
    </p>
    <p>If  <b>Use current map extent</b> is checked, only the features in the input and overlay layers that are visible within the current map extent will be overlaid.  If it is not checked, all features in both the input layer and the overlay layer will be overlaid, even if they are outside the current map extent.

            <p>In addition to choosing a layer from your map, you can select  <b>Choose Analysis Layer</b> found at the bottom of the drop-down list. This option opens a gallery where you can browse to and select datasets from various sources to use in your analysis.

You may optionally apply a filter on your input layer or apply a selection on hosted layers added to your map. Filters and selections are only applied for analysis.

                    <li> <b>Union</b>&mdash;All features from both layers will be combined, creating  a geometric union of the  input layer and  overlay layer.  All features and their attributes will be
