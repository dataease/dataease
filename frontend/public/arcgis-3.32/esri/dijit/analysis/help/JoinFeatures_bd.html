    <p>The Join  Features  tool works with two
layers. Join  Features  joins attributes from one
feature to another based on spatial, temporal, and attribute
relationships or some combination of the  three. The tool determines all input features that meet the specified join conditions and joins the second input layer to the first. You can optionally join all features to the matching features or summarize the matching features.
    </p>
    <p>Join Features can be applied to points, lines, areas, and tables. A temporal join requires that your input data is time-enabled, and a spatial join requires that your data has a geometry.

You may optionally apply a filter on your input layer or apply a selection on hosted layers added to your map. Filters and selections are only applied for analysis.

                    <li> <b>Join one to one</b>&mdash;This option summarizes all the matching features to each feature being joined.

            </p>
            <p>For example, suppose you wanted to find supermarkets within 2 kilometers of a farmer's market.   In this case, the target layer has a single feature representing a farmer's market, and the join layer represents the local grocery stores and has attributes such as total annual sales. Using the Join Features tool, you find that five grocery stores meet the criteria. If you specified a join operation of  <b>Join one to many</b>, you would end up with five features in your result, each row representing the farmer's market and a supermarket. If you specified a <b>Join one to one</b> relationship, you would end up with one feature representing the farmer's market and the summarized information from the supermarkets, such as the count (2), and other statistics such as the sum of annual sales.

                    <li> <b>Near Planar</b>&mdash;The features will be matched if they are within a specified distance of each other. The target   layer must be in a projected coordinate system, or the processing spatial reference must be set to a projected coordinate system using <b>Analysis Environments</b> if a spatial <b>Near</b> relationship is used.

                    <li> <b>Near Geodesic</b>&mdash;The features will be matched if they are within a specified distance of each other. The distance is measured using planar distance.

                <ul>
                    <li>Count&mdash;Calculates the number of nonnull values. It can be used on numeric fields or strings. The count of [null, 0, 2] is 2.

                    <li>Min&mdash;The minimum value of a numeric field. The minimum of [0, 2, null] is 0. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Max&mdash;The maximum value of a numeric field. The maximum value of [0, 2, null] is 2.
                    </li>
                    <li>Range&mdash;The range of a numeric field. This is calculated as the minimum values subtracted from the maximum value. The range of [0, null, 1] is 1. The range of [null, 4] is 0.
                    </li>
                    <li>Variance&mdash;The variance of a numeric field in a track. The  variance of [1] is null. The variance of [null, 1,0,1,1] is 0.25.
                    </li>
                    <li>Standard deviation&mdash;The standard deviation of a numeric field. The standard deviation of [1] is null. The standard deviation of [null, 1,0,1,1] is 0.5.

                    </li>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                All statistics are calculated on nonnull values. The resulting layer will contain a new field for each statistic calculated. Any number of statistics can be added by choosing an attribute and statistic.

In most cases, results should be stored to the spatiotemporal data store and this is the default. In some cases, saving results to the  relational data store is a good option. The following are reasons why you may want to store results to the relational data store: 
                <ul>
                    <li>You can use results in portal-to-portal collaboration.
