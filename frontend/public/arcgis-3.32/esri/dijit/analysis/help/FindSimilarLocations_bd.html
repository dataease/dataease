        <hr/>
    <p>Based on criteria you specify, the Find Similar Locations tool measures the similarity of locations in your candidate search layer to one or more reference locations.  This tool can answer questions such as 
        <ul>
            <li>Which of your stores are most similar to your top performers with regard to customer profiles?
            </li>
            <li>Based on characteristics of  villages hardest hit by the disease, which other villages are high risk?
            </li>
        </ul>
        To answer questions such as these, you provide the reference locations, the candidate search locations, and the fields representing the criteria you want to match.  The first input layer should  contain your reference or benchmark locations.  For example, this might be a layer containing your top performing stores or the villages hardest hit by the  disease.  You then specify the layer containing your candidate search locations.  This might be all of your stores or all other villages.  Finally, you  identify one or more fields to use for measuring similarity.  The Find Similar Locations tool will then rank all the candidate search locations by how closely they match your reference locations across all the fields you have selected.

            <p>In addition to choosing a layer from your map, you can choose  <b>Choose Analysis Layer</b> at the bottom of the drop-down list to browse to your contents for a big data file share dataset or feature layer. You may optionally apply a filter on your input layer or apply a selection on hosted layers added to your map. Filters and selections are only applied for analysis.

            <p>Use the selection buttons to identify the reference locations, if necessary. This option is only available if the features are drawn on the map (not available for a big data file share).  For example, if the input layer contains all the locations&mdash;the reference locations as well as the candidate search locations&mdash;you will need to use one of the selection tools to identify the reference locations.  If you create two separate layers, one with the reference locations and the other with all candidate search locations, you do not need to make a selection.
            </p>
            <p>If there is more than one reference location, a single location is created by averaging the values for each of the fields used to analyze similarity.
