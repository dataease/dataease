        <h2>Find Hot Spots</h2><p/>
        <h2><img src="./images/GUID-6D600155-AA9B-4F02-AD8B-2E84150AB743-web.png" alt="Find Hot Spots"></h2>
        <hr/>
    <p>The Find Hot Spots tool will determine if there is any statistically significant clustering in the spatial pattern of your data. 
        <ul>
            <li>Are your points (crime incidents, trees, or traffic accidents) really clustered?  How can you be sure?
            </li>
            <li>Have you truly discovered a statistically significant hot spot, or would your map tell a different story if you changed the way it was symbolized?
            </li>
        </ul>
        The Find Hot Spots tool will help you answer these questions with confidence.
    </p>
    <p>Even random spatial patterns exhibit some degree of clustering.  In addition, our eyes and brains naturally try to find patterns even when none exist.  Consequently, it can be difficult to know if the patterns in your data are the result of real spatial processes at work or just the result of random chance.  This is why researchers and analysts use statistical methods such as Find Hot Spots (Getis-Ord Gi*) to quantify spatial patterns.  When you do find statistically significant clustering in your data, you have valuable information.  Knowing where and when clustering occurs can provide important clues about the processes promoting the patterns you're seeing.  Knowing that residential burglaries, for example, are consistently higher in particular neighborhoods is vital information if you need to design effective prevention strategies, allocate scarce police resources, initiate neighborhood watch programs, authorize in-depth criminal investigations, or identify potential suspects.

        <div>
            <p>GeoAnalytics results are stored to an data store and exposed as a feature layer in   Portal for ArcGIS. In most cases, results should be stored to the spatiotemporal data store and this is the default. In some cases, saving results to the  relational data store is a good option. The following are reasons why you may want to store results to the relational data store: 
                <ul>
                    <li>You can use results in portal-to-portal collaboration.
                    </li>
                    <li>You can enable sync capabilities with your results.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>
            <p>You should not use the relational data store if you expect your GeoAnalytics results to increase and need to take advantage of the spatiotemporal big data store's capabilities to handle large amounts of data.

            <p> The name of the layer that will be created.  If you are writing to an ArcGIS Data Store, your results will be saved in  <b>My
Content</b> and added to the map. If you are writing to a big data file share, your results will be stored in the big data file share and added to its manifest. It will not be added to the map. The default name is based on the
tool name and the input layer name. If the layer already exists, the tool will fail.
            </p>
            <p>This result layer will show you statistically significant clusters of high and low values or point counts. If the result layer name already exists, you will be asked to rename it.
            </p>
            <p>When writing to   ArcGIS Data Store  (relational or spatiotemporal big data store) using the  <b>Save result in</b> drop-down box, you can specify
the name of a folder in <b>My Content</b> where the result will be
saved.
