        <hr/>
    <p>Areas that overlap or share a common boundary or attribute value are merged to form a single area.
    </p>
    <p>You can control which boundaries are merged by specifying a field. For example, if you have a layer of counties, and each county has a  <pre>State_Name</pre> attribute, you can dissolve boundaries using the <pre>State_Name</pre> attribute.  Counties will be merged if they have the same <pre>State_Name</pre> value.  The result is a layer of state boundaries.

            <p>In addition to choosing a layer from your map, you can choose  <b>Choose Analysis Layer</b> at the bottom of the drop-down list to browse to your contents for a big data file share dataset or feature layer. You may optionally apply a filter on your input layer or apply a selection on hosted layers added to your map. Filters and selections are only applied for analysis.

                    </li>
                    <li> <b>Areas with the same field value</b>&mdash;Two or more areas will be merged into one area if they have the same field value.
                    </li>

    <div id="multipart">
        <div><h2>Create multipart features</h2></div>
        <hr/>
        <div>
            <p>Multipart is a representation of a place or thing that has
more than one part but is defined as one feature because it
references one set of attributes. In a layer of states, for
example, Hawaii could be considered a multipart
feature because its separate geometric parts are classified as a
single state.
            </p>
            <p> <b>Create multipart features</b> offers two options:
                <ul>
                    <li>True (checked)&mdash; The output service can contain multipart features.
                    </li>
                    <li>False (unchecked)&mdash; The output service will only contain single-part features, and individual features will be created for each part. This is the default.
                    </li>
                </ul>

    <div id="summaryFields">
        <div><h2>Add statistics (optional)</h2></div>
        <hr/>
        <div>
            <p>When areas are merged, you can summarize their attribute values with meaningful statistics.  For example, if you are dissolving the boundary between counties based on  <pre>State_Name</pre>, and each county has a <i>Population</i> field, you could calculate the sum of <pre>Population</pre> for the state.
            </p>
            <p>You can calculate statistics on features that are summarized. You can calculate the following on numeric fields: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Count&mdash;Calculates the number of nonnull values. It can be used on numeric fields or strings. The count of [null, 0, 2] is 2.
                    </li>
                    <li>Sum&mdash;The sum of numeric values in a field. The sum of [null, null, 3] is 3.
                    </li>
                    <li>Mean&mdash;The mean of numeric values. The mean of [0, 2, null] is 1.
                    </li>
                    <li>Min&mdash;The minimum value of a numeric field. The minimum of [0, 2, null] is 0. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Max&mdash;The maximum value of a numeric field. The maximum value of [0, 2, null] is 2.
                    </li>
                    <li>Range&mdash;The range of a numeric field. This is calculated as the minimum values subtracted from the maximum value. The range of [0, null, 1] is 1. The range of [null, 4] is 0.
                    </li>
                    <li>Variance&mdash;The variance of a numeric field in a track. The  variance of [1] is null. The variance of [null, 1,0,1,1] is 0.25.
                    </li>
                    <li>Standard deviation&mdash;The standard deviation of a numeric field. The standard deviation of [1] is null. The standard deviation of [null, 1,0,1,1] is 0.5. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>
            <p>You can calculate the following on string fields:
                <ul>
                    <li>Count&mdash;The number of nonnull strings.
                    </li>
                    <li>Any&mdash;This statistic is a random sample of a string value in the specified field.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                All statistics are calculated on nonnull values. The resulting layer will contain a new field for each statistic calculated. Any number of statistics can be added by choosing an attribute and statistic. 
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div id="outputName">
        <div><h2>Result layer
name</h2></div>
        <hr/>
        <div>
            <p> The name of the layer that will be created.  If you are writing to an ArcGIS Data Store, your results will be saved in  <b>My

tool name and the input layer name. If the layer already exists, the tool will fail.
            </p>
            <p>When writing to   ArcGIS Data Store  (relational or spatiotemporal big data store) using the  <b>Save result in</b> drop-down box, you can specify
