Project description
	analytics and client monitoring system.  Including the base analytics
system and any number of plugins enables logging of different system data
back to the server.  Plugins included at this time:

	dojo - reports dojo startup  collected information
	window - reports available window information to the server
	mouseOver - allows periodic sampling of mouseOver 
	mouseClick - reports any mouse clicks to the server
	idle - reports idle/activity 
	consoleMessages - reports console.* messages to the server
	touchPress - reports touch.press and touch.release
	touchMove - allows periodic sampling during a touch.move
	gestureEvents - reports swipe, tap, tap.doubletap, tap.taphold	

	Additionally, a Google Analytics (Urchin tracker) helper is included
	in this project, though is unrelated to the Core dojox.analytics 
	project code.

Dependencies:

Dojo Core (package loader).

Documentation

Usage:

The primary intended usage will be to create a custom build layer that includes 
the particular plugins you need for your project.   However in practice you
can use the system as such:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="../../../dojo/dojo.js"
                djConfig="parseOnLoad: true, isDebug: false, usePlainJson: true, sendMethod: 'script', sendInterval: 5000"></script>

        <script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">
                // include the analytics system
                dojo.require("dojox.analytics");

                //tracks mouse clicks on the page
                dojo.require("dojox.analytics.plugins.mouseClick");

                // this plugin returns the information dojo collects when it launches
                dojo.require("dojox.analytics.plugins.dojo");

                // this plugin return the information the window has when it launches
                // and it also ties to a few events such as window.option
                dojo.require("dojox.analytics.plugins.window");

                // this plugin tracks console. message, It logs console.error, warn, and
                // info messages to the tracker.  It also defines console.rlog() which
                // can be used to log only to the server.  Note that if isDebug() is disabled
                // you will still see the console messages on the sever, but not in the actual
                // browser console.
                dojo.require("dojox.analytics.plugins.consoleMessages");

                // tracks where a mouse is on a page an what it is over, periodically sampling
                // and storing this data
                dojo.require("dojox.analytics.plugins.mouseOver");

                //tracks touch press and touch release on the page
                dojo.require("dojox.analytics.plugins.touchPress");

                // tracks where a touch move is done on a page, what it is over, periodically sampling
                // and storing this data
                dojo.require("dojox.analytics.plugins.touchMove");

                // tracks these gesture events tap, taphold, doubletap, and swipe using the dojox.gesture 
                // support. For swipe it will periodically sample and store the data
                dojo.require("dojox.analytics.plugins.gestureEvents");

                //tracks when the user has gone idle
                dojo.require("dojox.analytics.plugins.idle");

	</script> 

When done using a build, none of the dojo.require() statement will be requires 
would already be in the build. 

Most of the plugins and the base itself have a number of configurable params
that are passed in via the djConfig variable set.  This approach is taken so that
the parameters can be easily provided in the case of a build or for a custom
dojo.js build with analytics built in. Examples for different build profiles 
are in the profiles directory.

Available Configuration Parameters:

	Base Configs
	sendInterval - Normal send interval. Default 5000 
	sendMethod - "script" || "xhrPost"
	inTransitRetry - Delay before retrying an a send if it was in transit
			or if there is still data to be sent after a post.
			Default 1000
	analyticsUrl - url to send logging data to. defaults to the test php 
			file for now
	maxRequestSize - Maximum size of GET style requests. Capped at 2000 for 
			IE, and 4000 otherwise	

	consoleMessages Config:

	consoleLogFuncs - functions from the console object that you will log to 
			the server. If the console object doesn't exist
			or a particular method doesn't exist it will be
			created as a remote logging only method. This provides
			a quick and convenient way to automatically define
			a remote logging function that includes the functions
			name in the log.  The 'rlog' in the default parameters
			is an example of this.  Defaults to ["error", "warn", "info", "rlog"]	

	idle Config:
	
		idleTime - Number of ms to be idle before being reported to the server as idle

	mouseClick config:
		targetProps - the properties whose values will be reported for each target from
				a mouse click sample.  
				defaults to ["id","className","nodeName", "localName","href", "spellcheck", "lang"]

		textContentMaxChars - the max number of characters to show for text or textContent, defaults to 50

	mouseOver config:
		targetProps - the properties whose values will be reported for each target from
				a mouse over sample.  
				defaults to ["id","className","localName","href", "spellcheck", "lang", "textContent", "value" ]

		watchMouseOver - log mouseover and mouseout events defaults to true

		sampleDelay - the delay in ms between mouseover samples. Defaults to 2500

		textContentMaxChars - the max number of characters to show for text or textContent, defaults to 50

	window config:
		windowConnects - methods on the window objec that will be attached to 
				have its data passed to the server when called.

	touchPress config:
		targetProps - the properties whose values will be reported for each target from
				a touch.press or touch.release sample.  
				defaults to ["id","className","nodeName", "localName","href", "spellcheck", "lang"]

		textContentMaxChars - the max number of characters to show for text or textContent, defaults to 50

		showTouchesDetails - include the details for the touches in the touches array, defaults to true


	touchMove config:
		targetProps - the properties whose values will be reported for each target from
				a touch move sample.  
				defaults to ["id","className","localName","href", "spellcheck", "lang", "textContent", "value" ]

		textContentMaxChars - the max number of characters to show for text or textContent, defaults to 50

		showTouchesDetails - include the details for the touches in the touches array, defaults to true

		touchSampleDelay - the delay in ms between touch.move samples. Defaults to 1000

	gestureEvents config:
		targetProps - the properties whose values will be reported for each target from
				a gesture event (tap, taphold, doubletap, swipe) sample.  
				defaults to ["id","className","localName","href", "spellcheck", "lang", "textContent", "value" ]

		swipeSampleDelay - the delay in ms between swipe samples. Defaults to 1000

		textContentMaxChars - the max number of characters to show for text or textContent, defaults to 50

		watchSwipe - log swipe events in addition to the tap events, defaults to true


	
Note that the basic usage of this system simply serializes json with toJson() when passed
to the analytics addData() method.  If data is passed that has circular references
it will die.  Take care not to do that or be surprised when it doens't work
in those cases.
